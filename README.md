# ADF EMG Task Flow Tester

The ADF EMG Task Flow Tester is a web-based testing tool for ADF bounded task flows. It supports testing 
of task flows that use pages as well as task flows using page fragments. A sophisticated mechanism to specify 
task flow input parameters is provided. A set of task flow input parameters and run options can be saved as a 
task flow testcase. Task flows and their testcases can be exported to XML and imported from XML.
